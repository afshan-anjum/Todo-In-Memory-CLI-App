# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Project Root**: `D:\Todo App\`
- **Source Code**: `src/`
- **Tests**: `tests/`
- **Specifications**: `specs/` and `spec_history/`

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /sp.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan in `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with `uv` and create `uv.lock`.
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (e.g., ruff).

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks:

- [ ] T004 Create base `Task` model in `src/models/task.py`.
- [ ] T005 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure.
- [ ] T006 Implement the core `TaskService` in `src/services/task_service.py`.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test for [feature] in `tests/test_task_service.py`.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create `Task` model in `src/models/task.py` (if not already done).
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] logic in `src/services/task_service.py`.
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement UI interaction in `src/ui/console_ui.py`.
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation in `src/utils/validators.py`.
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in `README.md`.
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring.
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests in `tests/`.
- [ ] TXXX Run `quickstart.md` validation.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2).
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2).

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation.
- Models before services.
- Services before UI.
- Core implementation before integration.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2).
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
